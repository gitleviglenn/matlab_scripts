#  This directory contains matlab scripts that have been used to create preliminary work that uses the decomposition derived in 
#  Schwendike et al., 2014 to decompose the atmospheric circulation.  We then perform analysis that uses dynamical sampling that 
#  is based on the vertical pressure velocity on the 500 hPa pressure surface.  This closely follows the work described in Bony 
#  et al., 2004.
